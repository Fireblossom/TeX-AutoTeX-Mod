TeX-AutoTeX

This module is the basis for arXiv's (http://arXiv.org/) automatic (La-)TeX
processing. It has been abstracted from arXiv internals and an attempt has
been made to make this useful standalone. However this is not a turn-key
solution for document processing, instead it is intended to provide a basis
for integration with other systems.

The normal use is to point it at a directory containing an assortment of
files which constitute the source material for a (La-)TeX
document. TeX::AutoTeX::process then attempts to generated DVI, PostScript,
or PDF from the input based on heuristics which have been developed and
employed at arXiv for many years. The resulting file(s) remain in the same
directory. It is up to the calling process to pre- or post-process the
directory contents as required.

For example the directory contents could originate from a storage module or
repository system and is unpacked to flat files in a temporary directory
before TeX::AutoTeX is being invoked on that directory. The generated
PostScript or PDF is assumed to then be used in a document delivery system.

No particular naming conventions or other requirements are imposed on the
source material, and sub-directories are permitted. The module attempts to
determine processing order and input format based on file characteristics and
heuristics and generally does not require any user input. This distinguishes
TeX::AutoTeX from other existing frameworks, which require particular
configuration, or are based on specific Makefiles or similar constructs.

The system has been tuned to process scientific papers received at arXiv and
may not perform optimally in other settings. You are welcome to modify it to
your needs and are encouraged to communicate changes and improvements back to
arXiv.


WARNING 

TeX::AutoTeX::process will modify, overwrite, and delete files in the specified
directory. It is assumed that directory is a temporary working directory and
that the sources were copied from elsewhere for processing.


INSTALLATION

This module relies on the presence of a comprehensive TeX installation on the
host system to function. arXiv is using TeXLive 2009 and TeXLive 2010, but
MikTeX or similar should also work.

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install


CONFIGURATION

After installing, you must edit TeX::AutoTeX::Config to use your TeX
installation. See the comments in that file.

QUICKSTART

Make sure you have backups of your source files. Only invoke TeX::AutoTeX on
a copy in a temporary directory! Files in that directory may be modified,
overwritten, deleted or otherwise rendered unusable. You have been warned!

After installation, edit TeX::AutoTeX::Config (see CONFIGURATION), switch to
a temporary directory containing a copy of the (La-)TeX sources for a single
paper and then run:

perl -MCwd -MTeX::AutoTeX -e '$t=TeX::AutoTeX->new(workdir => getcwd, verbose => 1,); $t->process;'

See perldoc TeX::AutoTeX for more options.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
